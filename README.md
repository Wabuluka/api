# CRUD API - Andela
In this API, I have put together a simple way in which you can create, retrieve, update and delete data from a list
## Getting Started
To get start with this API, you will need to set up a few prerequists as I am going to guide below.
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Windows Mac or Linux
```

### Installing

Simply run the following command to generate a requirements.txt file

Say what the step will be

```
pip freeze>requirements.txt
```
## Running the tests

It only needs one code statement to run the test for this simple application

Run the following command in your terminal or cmd

```
python -m unittest
```

## Deployment

You can find a demo view of how this application works from heroku
